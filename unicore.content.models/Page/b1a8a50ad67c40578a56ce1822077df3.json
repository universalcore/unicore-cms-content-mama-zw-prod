  "content": "Your baby can be born any day now! Inside your womb he is shedding the fine\nhair he grew in the middle of pregnancy. He is also losing the waxy coating on\nhis skin which protected him while he was floating in the fluid inside your\nwomb. Your baby is developing layers of fat under his skin, which will help\nkeep him warm when he is born. Newborn babies need to be kept warm. The best\nway to do this is to hold him close to your chest inside your clothes. You may\nwonder how you will know when labour starts. There are three ways that labour\nmay begin. 1\\. You may notice a bloodstained discharge on your underwear. This\nis a sign that labour may begin in the next day or two. 2\\. You may have\ncontractions that feel like period pains. They get that stronger, regular and\nmore painful as labour progresses. 3\\. You may have a gush or trickle of\nwater. If this happens you should go straight to the health facility. Make\nsure you know how to get to the health facility before labour starts. You need\na midwife, nurse or doctor to care for you if you are in labour. Check that\nyou have credit on your phone and money for a bus or taxi. created by\nBabyCenter\n\n",
