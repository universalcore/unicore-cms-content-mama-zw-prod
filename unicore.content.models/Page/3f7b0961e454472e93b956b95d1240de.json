  "content": "Your baby starts to understand simple words and phrases. Try repeating his\nwords back to him, using adult language. Slowly, he will learn to be\nindependent, and will cry less when you leave him. But, sometimes, leaving him\ngoes badly and there will be tears! If he has something that smells of you,\nlike clothes you have worn, it will help him to settle. At this age, your baby\ncan sit confidently and may walk while he holds onto furniture. He may even\nlet go for a second and stand without support, or even take a few steps if you\nhold his hands. Around this age, your baby will learn to hand-feed himself an\nentire meal. He will want to drink from a cup. This is a new skill, and he\nwill need to practice for a few months to learn how! Your baby can understand\nsimple instructions now. But this doesn\u2019t mean he will always pay attention to\nthe word \u2018no\u2019! He will understand \u2018no\u2019 better if it is mainly used to help him\nlearn the difference between right and wrong, and safe and unsafe. created by\nBaby Centre\n\n",
