Enjoy watching him explore and discover his limits. He will learn for\nhimself in a safe environment. Your baby is learning about objects by shaking,\nbanging, dropping, and throwing them. He\u2019s learning about what he can do to an\nobject. Your baby will start to show interest in things you use. Slowly, he\nwill start to use objects properly. You may find him trying to brush his hair\nor drink from a cup. Your baby's vision is much clearer now. He can see almost\nas well as you. Now he can recognise people and objects across a room. He may\nsee a toy on the other side of the room and try to crawl towards it. His eyes\nare close to their final colour, too, though you may see small changes later.\nSoon, your baby will start to stand and move around the room by holding onto\nwalls and furniture. created by BabyCentre\n\n",
