Breastfeeding can make you thirsty. \r\n\r\nThen find a comfortable place to sit, where you can hold your baby in a position that will not make your arms and back ache. Make sure your back is supported and that you are not leaning backwards. \r\n\r\nHave some pillows or blankets nearby to help you to support your baby. Try different positions. Many mothers find that cradling their baby across their chest, raised up on a cushion or pillow, works well. Or tuck your baby under your arm so his feet point backwards and his head is by your breast. Do what is most comfortable for you. \r\n\r\nWhen you are both in a relaxed position, it is time to get your baby to take your breast into his mouth and start feeding. This is called latching on.\r\n\r\nYour baby\u2019s feed can take anything from 5 to 40 minutes. If you find noise distracting, find somewhere quiet. If you get bored, try feeding with the radio on or sit with a friend for company.\r\n",
