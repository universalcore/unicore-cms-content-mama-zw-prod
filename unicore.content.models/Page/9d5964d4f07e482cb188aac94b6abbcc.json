  "content": "I thought that once I delivered my baby, my tummy would go back to normal. But I gave birth 6 weeks ago and I still look pregnant! I cannot fit into any of my clothes and I am still wearing my pregnancy pants.\r\n\r\nI tried to squeeze myself into a pair of pre-pregnancy pants 2 days after the birth. I was amazed that I could not get them higher than my knees! Yesterday I tried again.\r\n\r\nI just couldn\u2019t wait to get back into normal clothes. I tucked handfuls of fat into the waistband. I finally got the button closed. \r\n\r\n - \u201cCome look!\u201d I called to my husband. \u201cI can fit back into my clothes!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe look of surprise on his face said it all: it was not good. \u201cWear them round the house until you are comfortable going out in public in them,\u201d he suggested.\r\n\r\nI took them off 10 minutes later. But only because they were too tight to sit down in. Now I am really feeling worried. Will this stomach ever go down? \r\n\r\n - \u201cGive yourself time,\u201d my friends tell me.   \r\n\u201cThe baby weight will come off in time.\u201d   \r\n\u201cHow much time?\u201d I ask.  \u201cA year,\u201d they promise.\r\n\r\nI can\u2019t believe it. A 40-week pregnancy and now I still look pregnant!\r\n\r\n**MAMA HELP: It is normal for a healthy pregnant woman to put on 10 to 14kgs (20 to 30 lbs) by the end of your term. The extra weight will give you a cushion for the months when you breastfeed your baby. You can work at losing the weight over time to get your shape back.**\r\n",
