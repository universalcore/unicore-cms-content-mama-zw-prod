  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nIt is exciting when you first feel your baby move! If this is your first pregnancy, you may not be sure what you are feeling at first. The baby moving feels like gentle butterflies fluttering in your tummy. \r\n\r\nYour baby's movements will get stronger and more regular. By the middle of pregnancy they will feel like real kicks. In late pregnancy, you may see your whole tummy moving as the baby moves around inside you.\r\n\r\nYour baby will not move all the time. Like you, sometimes he will want to rest and sleep.\r\n\r\nTake a moment to sit down and feel your baby move inside you each day.\r\n\r\nYou can get used to recognising the movements. Remember his daily routine, when he is awake and when he goes to sleep. You may find you wake up early because the baby is kicking. Or maybe the baby starts kicking when you sing or when you undress to wash.\r\n\r\nIf you think the movements have slowed down, have a long cold drink or a sweet snack and then sit quietly for a while. You should notice more movements. Tell a health worker if you notice a change in his routine.\r\n\r\nIf you have not felt your baby move yet, speak to a health worker. She will be able to check that all is well.\r\n",
