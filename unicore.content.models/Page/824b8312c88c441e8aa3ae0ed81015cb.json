  "content": "Your baby is ready to start family food along with breastmilk! He can only\nhave a tiny amount of food at first: just a spoonful is enough. He will enjoy\nmashed family food. Sit facing him and offer some soft food on your clean\nfinger or on a spoon. It may take him a while to know how to move the food\naround with his tongue and swallow it. Be patient. He will learn. Give him\nmashed food once a day to begin. Then twice a day and then three times a day.\nHe may want some breastmilk before the mashed food, and some more breastmilk\nafter the mashed food. This could be the month your baby gets his first tooth.\nOne of the bottom front teeth usually appears first. He may start to use one\nhand more than the other. Then he may switch hands. But you won't really know\nwhether he is right or left-handed until he's two or three years old. Let him\nhold a small object and pass it from hand to hand. This will help him develop\nhis skills. Your baby is probably getting more active now, and will enjoy the\ncompany of other babies! Does your baby like a certain object or toy? If so,\nsoon he will not be able to go anywhere without it. This is normal, and a sign\nof your baby's growing independence, because he can use a toy or cloth for\nreassurance instead of you. created by BabyCentre\n\n",
