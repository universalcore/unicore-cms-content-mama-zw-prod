  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nYour baby is still small enough to fit into the palm of your hand. She is growing hair on her head and fine, soft hair all over her body. On the tips of her fingers she is developing tiny fingerprints.\r\n\r\nInside your womb, your baby floats safely in fluid. She is protected from bumps and kept warm by the fluid. Babies can get hiccups. This feels like a regular drum beat in your womb, which can last a few minutes.\r\n\r\nYou may be feeling less nauseous now and find you are suddenly hungry. Eat well. Remember to eat a variety of foods each day. Eat an extra handful of food at each meal. Make sure your food is safe and fresh, not stale or old.\r\n\r\nYou will also gradually feel less tired and have more energy. The afterbirth or placenta has developed inside your womb now and this supports your baby. It will be delivered just after your baby is born.\r\n\r\nYou may find that your clothes feel a bit tighter around your waist and breasts. Your pregnancy will show soon, as a small bump low down on your tummy.\r\n\r\nBeing pregnant makes you less resistant to germs, so you may get more coughs and colds. Wash your hands with soap and clean, safe water regularly. It\u2019s the best way to get rid of germs.",
