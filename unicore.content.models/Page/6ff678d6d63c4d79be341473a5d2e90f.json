  "content": "Your baby is changing quickly. She can make basic sounds. She may even say\nsomething that sounds like \u2018Ma-ma\u2019 this month! Don't worry if she doesn't. All\nbabies develop differently. So far, she has needed your full-time attention.\nNow she may be happy amusing herself sometimes. You may find her happily\nplaying with her hands and feet! At this age, it is good for your baby to be\nwith loved ones or trusted friends. As she grows, your baby will need to learn\nsocial skills and how to interact with others. Your family will love having a\ncuddle! You can give her lots of cuddles when you get back. Even though crying\nis still your baby's best form of communication, she is also getting a sense\nof humour. Play peek-a-boo with her. See if she laughs when your face appears\nfrom under a blanket. Your baby will start to giggle and smile when you make\nfunny faces and she will enjoy lots of silliness. She will also enjoy hearing\nlots of sounds. Click your tongue, whistle or make animal noises. She will\nlove it. created by BabyCentre\n\n",
