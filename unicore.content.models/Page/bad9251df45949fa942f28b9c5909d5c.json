  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nIt is safest, and recommended, to give birth in a health facility, where there is help if there are problems.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot have your baby at a health facility, here is how to have a safe birth.\r\n\r\n - Plan to have a skilled birth attendant with you. She will help you to give birth safely and she will do what is necessary if there is a problem.\r\n\r\n - Make sure you have her phone number so you can call her in an emergency. \r\n\r\n - Have ambulance and taxi numbers ready and make sure you have enough airtime on your phone. \r\n\r\n - Make sure your family knows how to contact the birth attendant when it is time. \r\n\r\n - Make sure you have a birth kit ready. Your birth attendant may bring a birth kit. It will contain a plastic sheet, gloves, clean string and tools for cutting your baby's cord. All these items are important for a clean, safe birth. \r\n\r\n - If you cannot get a birth kit, find a clean sheet to have your baby on and 2 cloths, one to dry your baby and one to wrap her in. Have 2 pieces of clean string, a clean, sharp knife or a clean pair of scissors ready to cut the cord. Your attendant must wash her hands and you must wash between your legs. Get plenty of clean, boiled water and soap ready.\r\n",
