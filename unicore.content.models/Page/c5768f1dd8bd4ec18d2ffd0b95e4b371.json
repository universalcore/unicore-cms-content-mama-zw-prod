  "content": "Now your baby can open her eyes and turn her head towards light, even in the\nwomb! She can hear now, and may kick and jump when she hears loud sounds, and\nsettle down when you sing and talk to her. Soon she will get into a head-down\nposition inside you. Her head will be born first, so she turns upside down,\nready for labour to begin. As your bump gets bigger, it may be difficult to\nget comfortable and sleep well. Lie on your side and put a pillow between your\nlegs so your bump is supported. You may start to feel some hip pain because\nthe stretchy body tissue holding your hips to your pelvis may loosen. This is\nyour body preparing for labour. Kneeling on your hands and knees may help. You\nwill need to make a plan for going to the midwife or doctor in labour. Plan\nhow you will travel there, and perhaps ask a friend or relative if they will\nhelp. Talk to your family and make sure they know where you need to go. Go to\nthe health facility in late pregnancy so the nurse or health worker can check\nthat you and the baby are well. They can tell you what you need for the birth\nand when to go to the clinic in labour. created by BabyCentre\n\n",
