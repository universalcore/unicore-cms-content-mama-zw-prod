  "content": "Now your baby in your womb looks like a tiny newborn baby. Her eyes, eyebrows\nand eyelids have developed and her teeth are growing under her gums. The taste\nbuds on her tongue are developing. She will be able to taste your milk from\nthe first feed. She has a creamy white substance covering her skin. This\nprotects your baby\u2019s skin and helps with the birth. About this time, you may\nbegin to feel your baby's movements. It feels like tiny bubbles inside you. At\nfirst, you may not be sure what it is. Gradually the movements become stronger\nand you can then be sure that it is your baby kicking. It is an exciting\nmoment! You could also start to feel breathless now and you may feel clumsy.\nThis is because you are carrying more weight and your bump affects your\nbalance. You may have a heavier discharge and want to urinate more often. If\nyou notice some bleeding when you brush your teeth, it is because your\npregnancy hormones are making your gums swell and become sore, which can lead\nto bleeding. Brush every day, but be gentle. created by BabyCentre\n\n",
